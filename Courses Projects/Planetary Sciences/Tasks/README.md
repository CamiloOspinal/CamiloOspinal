# Tasks description
Here I give a brief description about the content of the tasks. My favorite tasks, those I recommend to read, are described in more detail and are in bold (Tasks were written in Spanish)

1. Taks 1: This was a pretty easy process where we calculated the mass of the Sun and Jupiter using the gravitation theory

2. Task 2: Jeans' mass and radii are computed for a diffuse molecular cloud and a giant molecular cloud. Also, the Sun nuclear time is obtained

3. Task 3: We discuss what the minimum mass of the solar nebula is and calculate the viscous time for a star of solar mass at 5 AU using the Shakura-Sunyaev model.

4. **Ì£Task 4:** We talk about the isolation mass of a planetoid and it is calculated at 1 and 5 AU. In this work I was very creative, I thought it might be a good idea to do a little scientific dissemination and get away from the rigor with which tasks are always done. I deeply believe that it is necessary to innovate, break molds, so I described the planetoid accretion process like a Battle Royale game.

5. **Task 5:** This is a little summary about Carbon Cycle on Earth. I found the topic very interesting and stimulating for me.

6. **Task 6:** Here I wrote my research on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. This assignment is one of my favorites, not because its elaboration was in-depth, but because it was closely related to the second set of problems, thus it was extremely helpful. I highly recommend taking a look at that problem set.
