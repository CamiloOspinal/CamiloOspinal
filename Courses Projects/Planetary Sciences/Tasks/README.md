# Tasks description
Here I give a brief description about the content of the tasks. My favorite tasks, those I recommend to read, are described in more detail and are in bold (Tasks were written in Spanish)

1. Taks 1: This was a pretty easy process where we calculated the mass of the Sun and Jupiter using the gravitation theory

2. Task 2: Jeans' mass and radii are computed for a diffuse molecular cloud and a giant molecular cloud. Also, the Sun nuclear time is obtained

3. Task 3: We discuss what the minimum mass of the solar nebula is and calculate the viscous time for a star of solar mass at 5 AU using the Shakura-Sunyaev model.

4. **Task 4:** We talk about the isolation mass of a planetoid and it is calculated at 1 and 5 AU.
