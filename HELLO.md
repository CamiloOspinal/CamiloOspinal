ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CamiloOspinal, a future (I hope) astronomer with soul of physicist, studying at University of Antioquia, and this is a litle bit about me.

My passion is learning about everything, I consider it the most invaluable gift of a scientist. That's why I'm drawn to nearly every topic in physics, 
astronomy, and other branches. Equally fascinating to me is the possibility of teaching what I've learned. This has led me to be part of:
* HERMES: A scientific outreach group born at the University of Antioquia, formed by students and teachers of Astronomy and Physics, we bring astronomy
to schools of all corners of Antioquia, but also other places like Cali, Caldas, or Huila. My contribution to the group have involved conducting astronomical observation
in several events, and I was one of the three official representative at the inaguration of the "Parque San Fernando" in Cali in December 2022.
* GRUNECO: This is the neuropsychology and behavior group of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Antioquia. They employ an MRI scanner for their investigations
on Alzheimer's and brain studies. My contribution for them was to be a sort of "scientific assessor", because they need to improve their knowledge in the MRI physics,
so I studied the topic and gave a couple of talks for the group members (doctors, bioengineers, among others). I like so much neuroscience, therefore I was happy there
interweaving it with physics.

Currently, I'm interested in too many things at the moment, I have to be honest, I like too many topics to choose only one, but I have been exploring 
planetary sciencie branch, so I will be working on that for a while. The only thing I know is that I would like to specialize in theoretical astronomy.

Someone told me that it could be a good idea to upload my courses projects and tasks here, maybe it could be of help for someone and maybe you can build some
better works with this. Also is a kind of academic diary for me.
